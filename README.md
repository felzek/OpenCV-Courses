OpenCV was started in Intel by Gary Bradsky in 1999 and the first release came out in 2000. It is implemented with C++, Python and Java interfaces and can take advantage of multicore processing. It is also enabled in OpenCL (Open Computing Language) , which is a framework for writing programs that execute across heterogeneous platforms.

I am going to mainly going to go over OpenCV-Python for learning purposes.
